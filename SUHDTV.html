<p>How the times have changed. Gone are the days of tiny television sets with finicky antenae that only display programs in black and white. Now we have televisions that seems to be getting bigger and bigger while also getting thinner and thinner. Popular Television brands include; Panasonic, LG, Sony and Samsung.</p>
    
<p>One of the most popular model of Television brand is the new Samsung Ultra High Definition Television. It is able to display images in clear and crisp 4K UHD, which is 4-times the detail and pixels than standard HD. Even the smallest of details on the screen is now easily discernable.</p>
    
<p>The television is also called a Smart TV. This is due to it possessing functionality similar to that of a smartphone. Using a remote or the TV screen's touchscreen, you can access apps such as Netflix and YouTube. Watching Shows and Videos in this way would be much more enjoyable compared to watching them on a lower resolution variant such as a smartphone or laptop. Younger children would also get enjoyment out of the television due to their being an App Store for downloading and playing games.</p>
    
<p>There are many size variants of the SUHDTV. They range from 40" for around &#36;1,500 euro up to &#36;11,000  for the 85" model, so easily within most people's budgets. </p>
