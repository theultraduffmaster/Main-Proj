    <p><b><u>Self- Driving Cars:</u></b>
In today&#39;s age we already have parking assisted cars that help the driver to park without hazard or damaging things around them that they may not see. Ford, Lincoln, Toyota, Lexus and BMW all offer this feature on a few of their select cars. 

But, in the near future we could see cars evolve to futuristic levels seen only in 60&#39;s sci-fi shows and movies. Many car companies are working on self-driving cars with their own unique flavours as seen in the video below with BMW vision 100. </p>

<p>
The car has two modes: Boost where the driver has full control and Ease mode where the &#34;Companion&#34; takes over all driving tasks and the interior is transformed into a comfort zone. The &#34;Companion&#34; is the digital intelligence built into the car which helps the driver with subtle, intuitive assistance while driving. As also seen in the above video the car also comes with live geometry which appears on the inside of the car on the dashboard alerting the driver to incidents and objects ahead while the geometry on the exterior of the vehicle is visible in the form of movable wheelhouse covers for optimal aerodynamics. The BMW Vision 100 is only a concept car for now but it shows where the future of cars lies and where car manufactures see the future of driving moving into.

        <b><u>Ford,</u></b> who was at CES 2016, a technology driven show, showed off at the show their work on the technology they&#39;ve been designing for cars mainly SyncConnect and Autonomous Driving. Ford SYNC or SyncConnect allows the driver to control any smart appliance in their home from their car with commands such as saying &#34;Did I shut the garage door?&#34; and the car will be able to respond to the question and you can then complete that action if it hasn&#39;t been completed already. At the same show Ford revealed they have been working on Autonomous driving for over 10 years but were reluctant to show exactly where that research had gotten them although saying they have come a long way with it there is no evidence that they have perfected it especially since they admitted they are still working on the algorithms for it. They closed out the show however with the note that their cars will not be intended for the super-rich like other car companies but instead they will make them readily available to the general public.</p>

    <p><b><u>Graphene:</u></b>
Graphene is a substance that doesn&#39;t necessarily get the coverage it should get since the benefits it has would greatly enhance basic life for a lot of people in the world. First produced in 2004 Graphene quickly become one of the most important materials ever created and since scientists have been looking to mass produce it.  The reason for it is because the substance is 100 times stronger than steel making it the best building material for construction and it can be used as a filter for water to help keep toxic waste out of the oceans. It can also be used to make smartphones virtually indestructible and make phone batteries essentially obsolete. On the atomic scale graphene is seen as a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms. It has been hailed as the substance that will cause a second industrial revolution where everything is made out of graphene and internet will also benefit from this making it faster than it&#39;s ever been. But its applications do not stop there it covers nearly every area in human life today &#45; Medicine, Electronics, Light Processing, Energy, Sensors, Environment and all the areas listed above, Graphene could improve the standard of human life exponentially to the point where science fiction from years ago actually becomes the standards for today&#39;s basic human rights.

    <p><b><u>Google Glass</u></b> is an AR (Augmented Reality) head-mounted display whose design is based on the everyday glasses people wear. The idea of it is that it fits neatly on your face and allows you access to information about the world around you. Originally Google released a prototype to &#34;Glass Explorers&#34; in the US and they stopped the prototype on January 15 2015 but then on December 28th of that year a new patent for the Google Glass was filed so Google&#39;s intentions for the project is to keep moving forward with the product. Security is a persistent issue with the device as it allows for photos and videos to be taken on the device which originally the device made no sound when doing so but since security was such a serious issue the device now makes a noise when it takes a photo or video. The device itself includes a touchpad on the side of the glasses for easy control of the devices functions as well as a side app called MyGlass can be downloaded to help manage the device. Right now Google Glass is the forefront of Google&#39;s innovations and probably the most popular device made to date and when its full release comes it will help to simplify a lot of tasks in everyday life including in the medical and journalism fields.
