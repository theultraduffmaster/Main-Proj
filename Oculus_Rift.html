    <p><b><u>History of Oculus Rift: </u></b>
Oculus (the original company behind the rift) was founded a mere 2 months before the initial proposal of the rift to Kickstarter. In 2012 they started their Kickstarter campaign to fund the rift&#39;s development. Their project proved to be successful making $2.5 million dollars. Oculus then started making development kits to show their progress on the project. There have been various pre-production models since the campaign and about 5 of those models were released to the general public. Two of which, were sent to the backers in 2012 as DK1 (Development Kit 1) and DK2 in 2014. This was done as a way to allow developers for the Rift develop their games for the product. In March 2014 Facebook purchased the Oculus Rift for $2 billion. July 2016 will see the shipping of the consumer version of the Oculus Rift which was delayed from January of the same year because of the volume of orders placed.</p>

        <b><u>Oculus Touch: </u></b>
Oculus also designed their own controllers for the rift but it&#39;s still compatible with the Xbox One controller. The Oculus Touch are a pair of twin motion controllers featuring joysticks, buttons, and two triggers- one for grabbing and one for shooting/firing. An IR LED sensor is used to track the movements and represent them in their virtual space to give the player a sensation of them actual being in that world. However, The Oculus Touch controller will not be included with the consumer version of the rift and instead will be sold separately in the second half of 2016</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Oculus Home:</u></b>
Home is the default environment for the rift if no other content exists. Here the player can launch VR (Virtual reality) applications they own, see their friends using Rift and they can even purchase VR content to add to Home from the Oculus Home Store. The store will be tailored to only allow for downloading content that can run smoothly on the user&#39;s hardware and also content will contain ratings informing the player of motion sickness or jump scares. Oculus have made this purely optional to developers for the Rift they can sell their content for the Rift in whatever manor they see fit. Oculus Home can also let you preview anything that you may want to buy.
    </p>
<p>
    <b><u>Future:</u></b> Because of the popularity that is rising in the VR department of gaming (and other areas later discussed) likely due to Playstation and Xbox announcing their own VR compatible devices for their consoles; Not to mention major phone companies HTC and Samsung have also thrown their hats into the ring; Oculus announced in June 2015 that Oculus were already working on the successor to the Rift which they will release 2-3 years after the first Rift.
    </p>
    <p>
Hopefully we&#39;ll see the Oculus Rift this summer and more delays won&#39;t plague this product so we can finally see a VR headset enter the gaming scene and see exactly the capability of the VR scene and hopefully get a sense where the future of gaming lies.
    </p>
    <p>
If you are interested in the world of VR technology then don&#39;t stop just at the Oculus Rift look into Playstation&#39;s VR headset, the Omni and even IBM are creating a VR environment based on the popular series Sword Art Online&#39;s NerveGear. And you may even be interested to look into AR (Augmented Reality) as well with Xbox and Google moving into that area.
