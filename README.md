## TechHub Website
# Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML

##Intro
This project is a website with articles written about the technology we may see in the future.

It is a group project undertaken by myself and two others.

We use:

1. Embeded video links
2. XML code for RSS Feeds
3. HTML events for expanding pictures
4. Surveys included
5. User enters in username
6. HTML for hovering over a button and text appears
7. JavaScript tp create a "slideshow effect" cycling through photos automatically
8. CSS to create a very uniform look and feel for the website
