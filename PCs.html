<p>A lot has changed since the creation of the first personal computers. The Simon was a project developed by Edmund Berkeley in October 1950. Although there were far more advanced machines at the time of its construction, the <i>Simon</i> represented the first experience of building an automatic simple digital computer, for educational purposes. <i>In 1950, it was sold for US$600</i>. Designed in <i>1971</i>, before microprocessors were invented, the Kenbak-1 had 256 bytes of memory and featured small and medium scale integrated circuits on a single circuit board. The title of first personal computer using a microprocessor went to the <i>1973 Micral</i>.</p>
    <p>Now in the year 2016 we have made many advancements on what makes up computers from when they started. Nowadays, computers contain multiple gigabytes of RAM, gigabytes and even terabytes of Hard Drive memory, powerful GPU's(Graphical Processing Unit) and even multi-core CPU(Central Processing Unit). All of these combined allow for many different and complex operations to take place in a matter of seconds insteads of hours and days back many years ago.</p>
    <p>In terms of gaming, increase in computational power has allowed games to change from being text-based(Microsoft Adventure) only, to 2-dimesional games(Prince of Persia) to the most commonly used method nowadays of 3-dimesions(Quake)which is the most complex to create. Due to low resolution and processing power, many early 3-d games had very angular and pixelated(Doom 2) but with higher resolutions such as HD and 4K, the pixelation is smoothed out leading to life-like characters in video games(Grand Theft Auto V)</p>
    <p>In the past, Laptops were portable in the fact that you were able to carry them around wherever you went. The main problem of this was finding a place in order to them connect an Ethernet Port in order to access the Web.Even being so bad as never being able to turn on if the internal battery was ever completely drained, even if it was charged after this point. This isn't much of a problem anymore as computer have built-in detectors which allow them to search and connect to Wi-fi without the need for cables and batteries being completely drained don't render the laptop useless. </p>
    <p>It's crazy to think of all the functionality that can come with most computers these days. Blu-ray drives, external Hard Drives, lcd light-up keyboards and multiple monitors for working through multiples programs. Back in the late 70's and 80's, some computers didn't even come with a monitor and had to be purchased seperately. This was annoying for consumers as the price of buying a computer during this time was expensive and buying other parts on top of this was very off-putting.</p>
